While sipping a cup of coffee, or just passing by a Starbucks store, how many of us actually think about the role analytics played in opening that store? Probably not many of us. But Analytics does play a major role in taking those business decisions.

These decisions are backed by many data points. But to take those decisions fast the representation of those data points matters a lot. So, here in this visualization we can see the Starbucks stores in India on a map and also we can see some statistical information about those stores in the same graph(those stats are dummy).
