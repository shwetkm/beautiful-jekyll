## Introduction

From the way e-tailers offer products to the way shoppers buy or transact online, Predictive Analytics has been reshaping and transforming the e-commerce industry.

E-commerce has taken the global market by a storm and is expected to grow exponentially in the upcoming years. A market research firm, eMarketer, projects e-commerce sales will eclipse $3.5 trillion within the next five years. Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, has planned to close hundreds of stores to refocus its efforts on its e-commerce site.

A big reason for this boom is the rapid growth in the internet and mobile users globally. E-commerce provides convenience to the users by giving better payment and advanced shipping options. It also provides a new level of customization and personalization by using some advanced analytics tools.

*Have you ever wondered how Amazon knows if you are a movie buff, a gadget freak or an avid reader? Or how Google knows that you were looking for a new laptop on some website? Or how do you get the recommendation for an ideal party wear, that you were looking for a long time, directly to your inbox?*

In this info graph, I intend to answer these questions and know how the e-commerce industry uses analytics.
